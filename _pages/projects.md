This portfolio showcases my experience in taking ideas from initial research to tangible, high-impact outcomes.

To help navigate each project, given their interdiciplinary nature, I use the STAR+I framework:
- **Situation**: Context and challenges.
- **Task**: Objectives and goals.
- **Action**: The steps taken to address the challenges.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Synthesizing across different disciplines.
- **Result**: Outcome and impact.
