<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
I have always been driven by the patterns that connect seemingly unrelated worlds, from the logic of code to the rhythms of biological systems, and from the physics of an aircraft to the market and geopolitical forces that shape an industry.

My journey has been a continuous exploration of these connections, fueled by a deep curiosity for how complex systems work, a desire to build things with a real-world impact, and the drive to translate complex breakthroughs into scalable, market-ready solutions.

*My most rewarding work has always occurred at the intersection of disciplines. **True breakthroughs don't happen in silos.***

## The Origin Story: From Aerospace to AI

It all began with my grandfather, an engineer who instilled my belief in **_first-principles thinking_**, and the value of understanding the fundamental truths behind complex systems. Growing up, I was captivated by the elegance of mathematics and physics, and the insights gained by studying history and psychology, but the intersection of these disciplines with real-world applications truly inspired me.

My upbringing drove me to pursue a degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Sheffield. I was fascinated by the elegant physics of flight, but my "aha!" moment came during an internship at **_Rolls-Royce_**. There, I wasn't just designing parts but using agent-based models to simulate market dynamics for hybrid-electric aircraft. I saw firsthand how I can combine abstract data, agentic models, and deep learning to predict real-world outcomes and **_drive billion-dollar business decisions_**. That experience ignited my passion for the power of AI and computational modeling.

Wishing to deepen my knowledge of AI led me to the University of Oxford for a DPhil, where I turned this passion for AI and data science towards one of the most complex systems imaginable: the human brain. Collaborating with **_GE Healthcare_** and **_Roche_**, I delved into multi-modal 3D neuroimaging, developing novel deep learning techniques to find new biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. My work wasn't just an academic exercise but about building **_open-source tools that accelerate research_** and improve patient outcomes, cementing my belief in technology as a force for good.

## My Guiding Philosophy

My approach is built on three core principles that bridge the gap from fundamental discovery to real-world impact.

### 1. Start with Why: The Pursuit of Foundational Knowledge
I believe in breaking down complex problems to their fundamental truths. Whether it's understanding the physics of a semiconductor or a customer's business need, a deep, **_first-principles understanding_** is the key to building robust and innovative solutions. This academic rigor, honed during my DPhil at Oxford, is the foundation of all my work.

### 2. Build with Purpose: From Theory to Tangible Tools
An idea is only as good as its execution. I am passionate about translating theory into **_tangible, high-performance systems_**, from open-source AI tools that accelerate Alzheimer's research to pioneering novel algorithms for next-generation hardware. This is the pragmatic, engineering-driven mindset that turns breakthroughs into reality.

### 3. Scale for Impact: Connecting Technology to Strategy
Technology does not exist in a vacuum. We measure its ultimate value by its real-world impact. I focus on connecting deep technical work to **_clear business outcomes_**, ensuring that innovation is not just novel, but also scalable, strategic, and commercially viable. This approach is how we move from a single success to transforming an entire industry.

## The "Now": In-Memory Computing & The Future

Today, at **_Synthara AG_**, I work at the cutting edge of this synthesis, pioneering new algorithms for in-memory computing that deliver unprecedented gains in performance and efficiency for AI in embedded systems. I am passionate about solving the **_"lab-to-market" challenge_**: how do we take incredible technological breakthroughs and turn them into scalable, market-ready products that solve critical industry challenges?

Outside my core work, I am driven by the challenge of building, mentoring, and leading teams to tackle ambitious deep-tech problems. As such, in addition to keeping up with the latest advancements in generative AI and keeping my coding skills sharp, I am currently educating myself on non-technical topics, such as **_project management, emotional intelligence, and business development fundamentals_**, marketing, finance, operations, and managing social and human capital.

I also believe in helping educate and inspire the next generation of innovators. To this end, I am actively involved in mentoring pupils and students from my native Romania in STEM and personal development, with an emphasis on underdeveloped regions and communities. By sharing my experiences and insights, I can help **_empower others to pursue their passions_** and make a difference in the world.
