## The Origin Story: From Aerospace to AI

Inspired early by my grandfather’s passion for first-principles thinking, I pursued Aerospace Engineering at Sheffield, captivated by the intersection of mathematics, physics, and real-world applications. A pivotal internship at **Rolls-Royce** showed me how agent-based modeling and AI could shape billion-dollar business decisions, setting my course towards computational modeling and applied AI.

My journey deepened at Oxford during my DPhil, where I applied advanced deep learning techniques to multimodal neuroimaging, collaborating closely with **GE Healthcare** and **Roche**. My research produced open-source tools accelerating neurodegenerative disease research, reinforcing my belief in technology as a powerful force for good.
