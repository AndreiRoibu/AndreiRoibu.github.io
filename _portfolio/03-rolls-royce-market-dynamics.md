<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
Delivered the strategic case for Rolls-Royce to enter the regional and eVTOL hybrid-electric aviation market, enabling the launch of business lines worth **$840M annually**.
</div>

## Situation

Rolls-Royce and its airline partners were exploring electrification in aviation. While significant progress existed in larger aircraft platforms, the viability of electrifying regional aviation markets remained uncertain. Key questions included:

* Was regional aviation a disruptive, viable entry point for electrification?
* Could an electrified regional aircraft be profitable, given complex market dynamics and high development costs?
* What design parameters, performance targets, and regulatory considerations would be required to succeed?

## Task

Despite my internship status, Rolls-Royce leadership tasked me with a critical strategic project to determine:

1. Market attractiveness and size for regional hybrid-electric aircraft.
2. Optimal aircraft design parameters and KPIs.
3. Estimated strategic and financial benefits to Rolls-Royce.

I regularly reported my findings directly to the Group CTO, senior management, and key airline partners.

## Action

Recognizing the complexity of regional aviation, I opted for an innovative, market-driven design approach:

* I leveraged and expanded an internal agent-based transportation model, simulating millions of passenger decisions based on economics, demographics, and travel preferences.
* In addition, I developed and integrated several multidisciplinary models, including:

  * **Aircraft Operating Cost Model:** Translated aircraft parameters into realistic costs per passenger-kilometer.
  * **Airport Noise Modeling Tool:** Assessed public sentiment and regulatory implications for new aircraft operations near population centers.
  * **Infrastructure Database:** Comprehensive mapping of regional airports, runway capabilities, and operational constraints.
  * **Environmental and Regulatory Models:** Analyzed regulatory frameworks, public sentiment, stakeholder influence and environmental impacts such as CO2 emissions and noise pollution.

Through extensive calibration and sensitivity analysis, I the identified the optimal parameters for market viability of regional aviation electrification across several key markets, including the US, Europe and India.

## Interdisciplinary Integration

This project combined deep insights from multiple domains:

* **Engineering & Physics:** Accurate modeling of aircraft performance and electrification implications.
* **Data Science & AI:** Development of sophisticated agent-based models and sensitivity analyses of high-dimensional parameter spaces.
* **Economics & Finance:** Cost modeling and translating technical capabilities into viable business scenarios.
* **Social & Political Analysis:** Understanding regulatory frameworks, public sentiment, union politics and stakeholder influences.

I synthesized these diverse inputs into a robust strategic recommendation, delivered to the project's key internal and external stakeholders.

## Result

My analysis clearly demonstrated a profitable, disruptive opportunity for hybrid-electric regional aircraft, with the following outcomes:

* **Enabled the launch of two new business lines (Regional & Advanced Air Mobility)** valued at over **\$840M annually**.
* Design was validated by major industry partners, including Airbus, forming the foundation for one of the [2022 Airbus ZeroE concepts](https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/energy-transition/hydrogen/zeroe-our-hydrogen-powered-aircraft).
* The project's success led to my further involvement in adapting the model to [Rolls-Royceâ€™s eVTOL "air taxi" initiative](https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/our-stories/discover/2018/blue-sky-thinking-rr-unveils-evtol-concept-at-farnborough-airshow.aspx), resulting in the creation of the Advanced Air Mobility division.
