## Situation

Brain ageing is an intricate, multifaceted process, marked not just by chronological time but by a myriad of structural, functional, and microstructural changes that often lead to discrepancies between the actual age of a individual and the apparent age of their brain. Accelerated brain ageing can have profound implications, and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, as well as with cognitive decline and other health issues. This makes the difference between chronological and appraent brain age a very useful biomarker for understanding which lifestyle, environmental, genetic and other factors contribute to accelerated brain ageing or resilience.

However, existing methods for brain age estimation typically relied on unimodal (structural MRI) data and traditional convolutional architectures, missing potentially infoirmative information from other modalities, such as functional or microstructural changes.
